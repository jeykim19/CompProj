The instructions to play the game will pop up in the opening message but, they are also here below:

Welcome to Space Adventure! Your goal is to rescue the ships on the planets without getting hit by asteroids.You move using w,a,s,d, rotate with q and e, and can shoot the asteroids using j. You are given 5 lives initially but rescuing the other ships on nearby planets will give back 1 life. If you or the trailing ships are hit, you will lose a life. When your life counter reaches 0, it's game over. Careful: The asteroids will turn into debris when they are hit/hit each other and while they CANNOT damage you, they CAN serve as distraction. Be viligant and good luck!
