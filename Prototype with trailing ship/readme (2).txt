To run the code, first:
1) javac *.java
2) java Prototype

This should bring up a screen. You will be able to control the spaceship using the w,a,s,d keys and rotate the ship using the q and e keys.

The program will also return false at every point except when ship hits an asteroid, at which point it will return true, showing that it can detect objects.
